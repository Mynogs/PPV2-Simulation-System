# PPV2-Simulation-System
This is the pre assembled image of the [P+ simulation system](https://www.elektronik-kompass.de/elektronikloesungen/pplus). 
The image has only the basic block libraries and functionality. 

The development of P+ ist spread over different Github repositories. All this repositories start with **PPV2-**.

There are block libraries like [PPV2-Tinkerforge](https://github.com/Mynogs/PPV2-Tinkerforge) to add blocks to control [Tinkerforge](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en) modules.

There are also injector scripts (to upload a simulation models to different hardware platforms), runtime images, scripts and other stuff.

### Install
Download the zip archive and unpack it. In the archive has the copyright notice and an other zip archive. 
P+ is stickware, so there is no install process and no installer. Simply unpack the nested archive in a folder on your computer disk or on a USB stick. Be sure you have read and write permission for this folder. 

### Install blocks
1. To install a block library, download the repository as zip file
2. Unpack the zip file
3. If there are a `.bmp` file copy the file to the Library folder in the P+ program folder
4. Copy the folder to the library folder
